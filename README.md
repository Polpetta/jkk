The aim of this project is to create a git-like tool to be integrated in the development workflow of an everyday developer.

We all know how frustrating can be leaving our beloved shell to check on a 2005-white-background Jenkins dashboard how
build is going on. Sometimes, one would just like to know if the build for the last commit passed or not. Jkk wants to
smooth this task by integrating the build information directly in the developer workflow.

If you want to get in touch with the developers or if you have any questions you can find us in our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/KkYr4Zb)!

## Installing
### From source
The project is configured using Gradle. It comes with the "application" plugin that allows to easily generate a
ready-to-use jar, wrapped up by a shell script.

- Clone the repo
- Use this command to generate a runnable cli:
    ```shell script
    ./gradlew installDist
    ```

You will find everything under `./build/install/jkk`, and the executable will be in under the `bin` directory.

### From the AUR
If you're lucky enough to use Arch Linux, someone has an AUR package just for you!
- `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/jkk-git.git`
- `cd jkk-git`
- `makepkg -si`
